# Overview  
The Assembly SOP Generator is a web-based application designed to streamline the creation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for manufacturing assembly processes. It solves the problem of time-consuming, manual SOP creation by providing a structured, user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of documenting assembly procedures. The target users are manufacturing engineers, quality assurance teams, and production managers who need to create consistent, professional SOPs for assembly operations.

The application provides significant value by:
- Reducing SOP creation time from hours to minutes
- Ensuring consistency across all SOPs through standardized templates
- Maintaining reusable databases of parts, tools, and fixtures
- Generating professional, print-ready documentation
- Improving safety compliance through structured safety requirement capture

# Core Features  
## 1. Database Management System
- **Parts Database**: Centralized repository for all assembly parts with part numbers, descriptions, and specifications
- **Tools Database**: Catalog of required tools with sizes, specifications, and identification numbers
- **Fixtures Database**: Collection of assembly fixtures, jigs, and testing devices with unique identifiers
- **Reusability**: Items added once can be reused across multiple SOPs, reducing redundant data entry

## 2. SOP Information Capture
- **Basic Information**: SOP title, part numbers, revision levels, author/department information
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: Dynamic selection from parts database with quantities
- **Required Tools & Equipment**: Selection from tools and fixtures databases
- **Safety Requirements**: Standardized safety pictograms and custom safety notes
- **Assembly Sequence**: Step-by-step procedure documentation with quality checkpoints

## 3. Professional SOP Generation
- **Formatted Output**: Generates professional, standardized SOP documents
- **Visual Layout**: Includes tables, headers, and structured formatting
- **Image Placeholders**: Designated spaces for assembly step images
- **Quality Integration**: Embedded quality checkpoints within assembly steps
- **Print-Ready Format**: Professional document suitable for shop floor use

## 4. User Experience Features
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern UI following Optimal AI brand guidelines
- **Dynamic Forms**: Add/remove items dynamically for BOM, tools, and assembly steps
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of generated SOP as users input information
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and tablet devices for shop floor accessibility

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **Manufacturing Engineer**: Creates detailed SOPs for new assembly processes, needs comprehensive documentation capabilities
- **Quality Assurance Manager**: Reviews and approves SOPs, requires clear quality checkpoint integration
- **Production Supervisor**: Uses SOPs on shop floor, needs clear, visual, easy-to-follow procedures

## Key User Flows
1. **Database Setup Flow**: User adds parts, tools, and fixtures to respective databases for reuse
2. **SOP Creation Flow**: User creates new SOP by filling out basic info → selecting BOM items → choosing tools → defining safety requirements → documenting assembly steps → generating final SOP
3. **SOP Review Flow**: User previews generated SOP, makes adjustments, and exports final document

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information organized in logical sections to avoid overwhelming users
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section headers and color coding (Optimal AI brand colors: #055263, #3a7d8c, #ff7d3b)
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, clear typography, keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tablet-friendly for shop floor use

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Frontend**: Modern web application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **Database Layer**: Local storage or lightweight database for parts/tools/fixtures databases
- **Document Generation Engine**: Client-side PDF/HTML generation for SOP output
- **State Management**: JavaScript-based state management for form data and user inputs

## Data Models
- **Part Model**: {id, name, partNumber, description, specifications, category}
- **Tool Model**: {id, name, size, specifications, identifier, category}
- **Fixture Model**: {id, name, identifier, description, category}
- **SOP Model**: {title, partNumber, revision, author, bom[], tools[], safety[], steps[]}
- **Assembly Step Model**: {stepNumber, description, parts[], tools[], qualityCheck, qualityDescription}

## APIs and Integrations
- **Local Storage API**: For persisting database items and SOP drafts
- **Print API**: Browser print functionality for SOP output
- **File Export API**: PDF generation or HTML export capabilities
- **Image Upload API**: Future integration for step images

## Infrastructure Requirements
- **Web Server**: Static file hosting (can be served from any web server)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers supporting ES6+, CSS Grid, Flexbox
- **Storage**: Client-side storage for databases and SOP data
- **Performance**: Optimized for quick loading and responsive interactions
