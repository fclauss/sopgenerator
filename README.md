# Assembly SOP Generator

A web-based application designed to streamline the creation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for manufacturing assembly processes.

## Overview

The Assembly SOP Generator solves the problem of time-consuming, manual SOP creation by providing a structured, user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of documenting assembly procedures. It's designed for manufacturing engineers, quality assurance teams, and production managers who need to create consistent, professional SOPs for assembly operations.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Database Management**: Centralized repositories for parts, tools, and fixtures
- **SOP Information Capture**: Structured forms for basic information, BOM, tools, safety, and assembly steps
- **Professional SOP Generation**: Formatted, print-ready documentation
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of generated SOPs
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices

### Key Benefits
- Reduces SOP creation time from hours to minutes
- Ensures consistency across all SOPs through standardized templates
- Maintains reusable databases of parts, tools, and fixtures
- Improves safety compliance through structured safety requirement capture

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, Optimal AI brand guidelines
- **Storage**: Local Storage API for data persistence
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Roboto)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Web server (for local development) or static hosting service

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fclauss/sopgenerator.git
   cd sopgenerator
   ```

2. Serve the files using a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Usage

1. **Database Setup**: Start by adding parts, tools, and fixtures to their respective databases
2. **SOP Creation**: Navigate through the form sections:
   - Basic Information
   - Database Management
   - Bill of Materials (BOM)
   - Required Tools & Equipment
   - Safety Requirements
   - Assembly Sequence
3. **Preview & Generate**: Use the preview panel to see your SOP in real-time
4. **Export**: Generate the final SOP document
